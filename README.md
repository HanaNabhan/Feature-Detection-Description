A hands-on exploration of **feature detection and description** techniques using OpenCV.  
This project compares **ORB and SIFT** methods on sample images to highlight their strengths and weaknesses in real-world computer vision tasks.

## üì∏ Example Results  

### ORB (FAST + Binary Descriptors)  
Fast and efficient, works well for real-time applications.

### SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)  
Robust to scale and rotation, but slower.

## ‚ö° Techniques Implemented  

- **Feature Detection**: Finding keypoints (corners, blobs, edges).  
- **Feature Description**: Computing feature vectors that describe keypoints.  
- **Matching**: Comparing features across images using Brute-Force or FLANN matcher.
